# GCViT

## Overview

The GCViT model was proposed in [Global Context Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09959) by Ali Hatamizadeh, Hongxu Yin, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov.
A similar architecture proposed for ViT but joining global context self-attention modules, as an alternative to complex operations such as an attention masks or local windows shifting.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We propose global context vision transformer (GC ViT), a novel architecture that enhances parameter and compute utilization for computer vision tasks. The core of the novel model are global context self-attention modules, joint with standard local self-attention, to effectively yet efficiently model both long and short-range spatial interactions, as an alternative to complex operations such as an attention masks or local windows shifting. While the local self-attention modules are responsible for modeling short-range information, the global query tokens are shared across all global self-attention modules to interact with local key and values. In addition, we address the lack of inductive bias in ViTs and improve the modeling of inter-channel dependencies by proposing a novel downsampler which leverages a parameter-efficient fused inverted residual block. The proposed GC ViT achieves new state-of-the-art performance across image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. On ImageNet-1K dataset for classification, GC ViT models with 51M, 90M and 201M parameters achieve 84.3%, 84.9% and 85.6% Top-1 accuracy, respectively, surpassing comparably-sized prior art such as CNN-based ConvNeXt and ViT-based Swin Transformer. Pre-trained GC ViT backbones in downstream tasks of object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets outperform prior work consistently, sometimes by large margins.*
